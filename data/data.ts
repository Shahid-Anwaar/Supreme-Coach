You get real advice from real entrepreneurs who have been through every struggle you can think of. It’s not just theory—it’s real-world strategies, lessons from failures, and insights you won’t find in a textbook. One of the biggest takeaways? You don’t have to figure it all out alone. Building a business can feel isolating, but surrounding yourself with the right people changes everything. Hearing from founders who have been in the same trenches—solving the same problems—gave me perspectives I never would’ve considered on my own. I also love how Supreme Coach is always adding new material and new resources for students. Can't wait to see what 2025 has in store! 📌 Lesson learned: The best investment you can make is in learning from others. A huge thanks to the Supreme Coach team and the incredible entrepreneurs in the program. Now, it’s time to apply what I’ve learned!

    text: "I have studied at 6 different universities, some of which I graduated with a degree, others I didn't. While I still have a special place for academia in my life, and while I'm still planning to pursue my PhD in social sciences, there's a reality that keeps striking me every time I think back about my academic journeys. I can describe my academic journeys as enriching and eye-opening, but also economically straining and socially exclusionist. I can also confidently say that classic education still got a long way before it becomes aligned with real-life and market skills. I am delighted to share that I’ve started my Master of Business Administration - MBA at Supreme Coach. Supreme Coach's mission is to democratise business education, enabling access to a wider audience, away from systemic selectivism that is strengthened by socio-economic factors. Supreme Coach's objective is also to form people with market-ready skills and a growth make-it-happen mindset. #business #education #mba #growth #Supreme Coachmba Voir la traduction",

  {
    question: "What exactly do you deliver at the end of a project?",
    answer:
      "We deliver a fully functional, fully deployed coaching business infrastructure running on your own server or hosting account. This includes your website, your lead generation system, your client portal and CRM, your programme delivery system, and all configured integrations — depending on your plan. You receive full admin access, complete documentation, and a training session. After delivery, you own and control everything.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to have my own server or hosting?",
    answer:
      "We assist with server setup and configuration as part of the project. If you do not have existing hosting, we will recommend suitable options for your build and help you set up the account. The hosting remains in your name and under your payment — we do not resell hosting.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the NDA actually protect?",
    answer:
      "The mutual non-disclosure agreement protects the specific architecture, configuration, and proprietary components of your coaching infrastructure. We commit to never sharing, replicating, or disclosing the specifics of your build to other coaching businesses, particularly competitors in your niche. The agreement is signed before project completion and remains in effect permanently.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a build take?",
    answer:
      "Basic builds typically complete in 10–14 business days from onboarding. Growth builds take 14–21 business days. Business builds are scoped individually but typically run 3–5 weeks from onboarding. Timeline depends on the speed of asset provision from your side — copy, branding assets, photography.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to change something after delivery?",
    answer:
      "You have full admin access to your infrastructure and can make most changes independently. For more significant changes — new features, additional integrations, or expansion builds — our team is available for ongoing project work. There is no mandatory support retainer.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Is Supreme Coach's infrastructure based on existing technology, or built from scratch?",
    answer:
      "We use proven, industry-standard open technology — no proprietary languages or frameworks that would create future dependency. What is proprietary is our architecture logic, our coaching-specific configurations, and our build methodology. The underlying technologies are widely supported and maintainable by any competent development team.",
  },
];

export const contactFaqs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What should I prepare before the strategy call?",
    answer:
      "Nothing formal. If you can briefly describe your coaching model, your ideal client, and what you want your coaching business to accomplish — that is enough to have a productive first call. We will ask the right questions to get to a clear project scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I am not sure which build level I need?",
    answer:
      "That is exactly what the strategy call resolves. We will assess your situation honestly — including recommending a smaller build if that is what your current stage needs — and give you a clear recommendation with our reasoning.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a non-disclosure agreement for the strategy call itself?",
    answer:
      "If you have concerns about sharing your coaching methodology or business details before a formal NDA is in place, let us know when you request the call. We are happy to sign a call-level NDA before the session begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long from strategy call to delivery?",
    answer:
      "Basic builds: 10–14 business days. Growth builds: 14–21 business days. Business builds: 3–5 weeks, scoped individually. All timelines assume timely provision of required assets from your side — brand guidelines, copy brief, photography.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with coaches and firms outside the UK?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We work with coaching professionals globally. Project pricing is in GBP. Calls are conducted via Zoom across all time zones. Data residency for server deployment can be configured to your jurisdiction's requirements.",
  },
];

export const pricingFaqs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "These look expensive. How do I justify this to myself?",
    answer:
      "Run the numbers for your coaching business. If you currently spend £200/month on tools — website, CRM, email, booking, course platform — you spend £2,400 every year, indefinitely. Supreme Coach Basic at £7,000 breaks even in under 3 years on tool savings alone. After that, every year costs you nothing in platform fees. And unlike subscription tools, your investment produces an asset you own — a professional coaching business infrastructure that compounds in value as your reputation and client base grow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are payment plans available?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can structure the project investment across instalments. Speak to our team to arrange a payment schedule that works for your cash flow. Typically we agree a build commencement payment and a completion payment, with flexibility on timelines.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between 'Build' and a subscription plan?",
    answer:
      "A subscription plan gives you access to someone else's platform for as long as you keep paying. A Supreme Coach Build is a custom project — we design, build, and deploy infrastructure on your servers, and it belongs to you permanently. There is no ongoing access fee because you are not accessing our platform. You are running your own.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start with Basic and expand later?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Coaches typically start with Basic, build their client base, and then commission a Growth build when they are ready to systematise client management and programme delivery. You pay the project fee for each build phase — there is no penalty for staging your investment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are my hosting costs after the build?",
    answer:
      "Hosting costs depend on the infrastructure scale of your build. For most individual coaches, quality managed hosting runs £15–40/month. For firm-level builds, hosting requirements vary. We recommend specific hosting configurations for each build and help you set up the account — the cost is transparent before we begin.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you take a percentage of my coaching revenue?",
    answer:
      "No. Zero. What you earn from your coaching business is entirely yours. Supreme Coach's compensation ends at project delivery.",
  },
];

export const productFaqs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "Are these 'ready-made' solutions or truly custom?",
    answer:
      "Both, in a specific way. We use proven frameworks — infrastructure patterns we have developed and tested across many coaching businesses — as the foundation for every build. These frameworks eliminate the inefficiency of starting from scratch and incorporate years of refinement. On top of these foundations, we customise every component to your brand, your methodology, your programmes, and your audience. The result looks and functions as a fully custom build because, from your perspective and your clients' perspective, it is.",
  },
  {
    question: "What technology is the infrastructure built on?",
    answer:
      "We use industry-standard, widely supported web technologies — not proprietary frameworks that create dependency on our team. After delivery, any competent web development professional can maintain and extend your infrastructure. We will discuss the specific technology stack in detail during your strategy call — we are transparent about every component.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I extend the build later?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your infrastructure is designed to be extensible. Future projects can add new components, new integrations, or expanded capability. Because everything runs on your servers, there is no platform restriction on what can be added.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if something breaks after delivery?",
    answer:
      "We provide structured handover documentation and admin training so your team can handle routine maintenance independently. For anything beyond routine maintenance, our team is available for ongoing support as a separate project or retainer arrangement.",
  },

  {
    question:
      "Our corporate clients require GDPR-compliant data handling. How does this work?",
    answer:
      "When your infrastructure is deployed on your own servers, you have complete control over data handling. We configure the build to GDPR standards — data residency, encryption, consent management, data subject rights — and provide documentation for your compliance officer.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "We currently use a mix of platforms. How disruptive is the migration?",
    answer:
      "We manage migration as a structured project workstream, not an afterthought. Client data, programme content, and email lists are migrated with full validation before the old infrastructure is decommissioned. Your clients typically experience no disruption — they simply find a significantly improved environment.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "We have proprietary coaching frameworks and methodology. How is this protected?",
    answer:
      "Your methodology, programme architecture, and proprietary frameworks are covered by the NDA we sign before delivery. Beyond the legal protection, because your infrastructure is deployed on your servers, there is no third-party access to your content — unlike SaaS platforms where your content sits on their servers.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can we commission additional development after the initial build?",
    answer:
      "Yes. As your firm grows and requirements change, our team is available for additional development projects — new programme types, additional integrations, expanded features, or entirely new infrastructure components. There is no lock-in to using Supreme Coach for maintenance, but most firms continue working with us because we understand their infrastructure intimately.",

    question: "I am a solo coach — is this too much infrastructure for my stage?",
    answer:
      "Our Basic build is specifically sized for solo coaches at any stage. It gives you everything you need to operate as a professional coaching business — website, lead generation, email, booking, and payment infrastructure — without the complexity of enterprise features you do not need yet. As your practice grows, you can commission Growth or Business builds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to find my own hosting before we start?",
    answer:
      "No. We help you set up appropriate hosting as part of the project. We will recommend options that match your technical comfort level — from managed hosting that requires very little technical knowledge to maintain, through to more developer-friendly infrastructure for coaches who want full technical control. The hosting is in your name and under your payment from day one.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to my existing website and client base?",
    answer:
      "We coordinate migration of your existing content, client contact lists, and email subscribers as part of the project handover. Your existing clients experience minimal disruption, and in most cases the transition is invisible to them — they simply find their portal and programmes in a significantly better environment than before.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I manage the website content myself after delivery?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your website is built with a content management system that allows you to update copy, add blog posts, change images, and edit page content without technical skills. We provide training on the CMS as part of the handover.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will this work if I serve clients internationally?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your infrastructure can be configured for international delivery — Stripe supports 135+ currencies, your portal and website are accessible globally, and your email marketing can be segmented by geography. The only consideration for some coaches is data sovereignty — if your clients are in the EU, we can ensure your server infrastructure meets GDPR requirements.",
